<img src="./assets/learn-nation-logo.webp" alt="learn nation logo" width="350">

## Task Overview

LearnNation is assembling a specialized AI development team to lead our next generation of educational technology. This project will serve as an assessment of your potential to join this team. As part of our strategic initiative to explore new frontiers in personalized learning, you will develop an AI-powered terminal assistant using Python and the Gemini API. Your performance on this project will be a key factor in determining your role in LearnNation's AI future.

#### This project serves two key purposes:

1. **Skill Assessment & Growth**: This task evaluates your ability to work with emerging AI technologies and complex software systems. Strong performance could lead to opportunities in our new AI Integration Department, where you'll help shape LearnNation's next generation of educational tools.

2. **Product Prototyping**: Your assistant will serve as a prototype for LearnNation's expansion into AI-enhanced learning experiences. The most successful implementations may be selected for further development and integration into our core product offerings, with the original developers taking lead roles in those initiatives.

## What is an AI Assistant?

An AI assistant is a software application that uses artificial intelligence to engage in natural language conversations with users. Your assistant will:
- Process and understand natural language inputs
- Generate contextually relevant responses
- Maintain conversation context
- Provide specialized knowledge in a specific domain
- Adapt responses based on user interactions

## Scope

You will build a terminal-based AI assistant that specializes in a specific knowledge domain. The task is structured in tiers, allowing us to evaluate both core competencies and advanced capabilities.

## Choose Your Assistant's Specialty

Select one of the following specialties or propose your own (subject to approval):

1. Fitness Coach
1. Creative Writing Mentor
1. Personal Finance Advisor
1. Cooking Companion
1. Travel Planner
1. Language Learning Partner
1. Mindfulness Guide
1. DIY Project Helper
1. Career Development Coach
1. Environmental Advisor
1. Tech Support Assistant
1. Gardening Guide
1. Productivity Coach
1. Wine Suggester

## Development Tiers

### Tier 1: Core Assistant Implementation
**Required - This is the foundation of your assistant**

Focus: Build a functional AI assistant that can engage in specialty-specific conversations.

**Requirements:**
- Configure Gemini API integration
- Implement specialized system instructions
- Create basic conversation handling
- Add error handling for API interactions
- Ensure responses align with the chosen specialty

### Tier 2: Enhanced Context Management
**Optional - Adds intelligence to your assistant**

- Focus: Improve response relevance through topic classification using keywords.
- Relevance: Improve specificity of responses using system instructions.
- Control Output: Improve the quality of responses using output formatting and few shot prompting.


**Requirements:**
- Define specialty-specific topics and subtopics
- Implement topic classification for user inputs
- Enhance prompts with topic context
- Add basic memory of current conversation

### Tier 3: Advanced Features
**Optional - For additional functionality**

Focus: Add conversation storage and analysis capabilities.

**Requirements:**
- Implement conversation history storage
- Add conversation summarization
- Create conversation search functionality
- Enable data persistence between sessions

## Testing Requirements

1. Core Functionality (Required):
   - API integration works correctly
   - Assistant stays in character
   - Responses are relevant and helpful
   - Error handling works effectively

2. Enhanced Features (If implemented):
   - Topic classification is accurate
   - Context management improves responses
   - Storage and retrieval work correctly

## Presentation

You will present your AI assistant to colleagues and supervisors in a technical demonstration session. Your presentation should include:

- Demo of your AI Assistant
- Explanation of NLP strategies used
- Technical Description of a piece of your code

### Preparation Guidelines
- Be prepared to explain your code at both high and low levels
- Practice your live demo with various test cases
- Document any known limitations or areas for improvement
- Prepare to discuss potential future enhancements

## Strategic Impact

Your work on this assignment has the potential to:
1. Shape LearnNation's approach to AI-enhanced learning
2. Establish best practices for future AI integrations
3. Create new opportunities for personalized education
4. Define the foundation for our next generation of products

## Career Development Opportunities

Based on performance, developers may be:
